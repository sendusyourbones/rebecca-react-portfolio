# My React Portfolio

## Description

I created this website to showcase the applications I have built to potential employers, and to tell them a bit about me. Potential employers can use the site to contact me, download my resume and view my proficiencies, and visit my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow profiles. The site was built using React.

## Usage

View the [deployed appliation]().

- When you first visit the site, you are taken to the "About Me" page with a short description about myself.
- To review my work, click the "Portfolio" link in the header. Click the "View Application" button to check out the deployed application, or click "View GitHub Repository" to see the code on GitHub.
- To contact me, click the "Contact" link in the header and complete the form. Note that all the fields are required.
- To download my resume and view a list of my proficiences, click "Resume" in the header.
- To visit my GitHub, LinkedIn, or Stack Overflow profile page, click the corresponding logos in the footer of any page.

## Credits

The website was built using [React](https://react.dev/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). I also leveraged [MaterialUI](https://v4.mui.com/) for the contact form fields.

I referenced the following articles when troubleshooting some issues:
- Stack Overflow - [how to download file in react js](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50694881/how-to-download-file-in-react-js)
    - This helped with allowing the user to download my resume
- freeCodeCamp - [How to keep your footer where it belongs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/)
    - This helped with displaying the footer at the bottom of the window if the content did not reach the bottom, and below the content if the content went past the bottom of the window
